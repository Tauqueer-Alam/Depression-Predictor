# Depression-Predictor
This project utilizes a machine learning model to predict whether a person is experiencing depression based on input data. The model is built using Python and deployed using Flask, allowing for a simple and interactive web-based interface. It demonstrates the use of data preprocessing, model training, and API deployment for real-world mental health predictions.
